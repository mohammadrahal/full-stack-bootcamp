# JavaScript Challenge 1

## Goals of Challenge 1

- Linking JS file
- Variables
- Data types
- Differences between let, const, var
- Basic operations
- Operator precedence
- Template literals

### Step 1

- Link the existing JS file to the HTML file.
- Review the code within the JS file.
- Open the HTML file in a browser and ensure successful JS file linkage.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 1"

### Step 2

- Inside the JS file, declare a variable `name`.
- Assign your name as the value for the `name` variable.
- Display the value of the variable in an alert box.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 2"

### Step 3

- Declare 3 variables (`age`, `lastName`, `DOB`) using 3 different declaration methods.
- Assign appropriate values to each variable.
- Experiment with changing variable values.
- Log all 3 variables to the console.
- Compare the outcomes of the three declaration methods.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 3"

## Exploring Data Types

### Step 4

- Log the data types of the following values to the console:
  - `"This is a text"`
  - `true`
  - `false`
  - `1215`
  - `"999"`
  - `{}`
  - `[]`
  - `null`
  - `undefined`
- Declare 6 variables and assign them different data types.
- Log each variable along with its data type.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 4"

### Step 5

- Declare a variable `myText` and assign a string value to it.
- Use three different ways to declare strings: double quotations, single quotations, and backticks.
- Research interpolation and apply it in the examples.
  ```javascript
  const counter = 3;
  const backtick = `This is my text using backticks ${counter} times`;
  const singleQuote =
    'This is my text using single quotations ${counter} times';
  const doubleQuote =
    "This is my text using double quotations ${counter} times";
  const tryThisAlso = `This is my new version, itâ€™s the ${2 + 3}th version`;
  ```
- Copy the above code snippet into the JS file.
- Log all the variables in the provided code snippet to the console.
- Explain the differences between these string declaration methods in the console.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 5"

### Step 6

- Declare 2 string variables of your choice.
- Declare a new variable `result`.
- Concatenate the values of the first two variables and assign the result to the `result` variable.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 6"

## Exploring Operators

### Step 7

- Understand the differences between the following operators:
  - strict equality operator (`===`)
  - strict inequality operator (`!==`)
  - loose equality operator (`==`)
  - loose inequality operator (`!=`)
- Use each of these operators at least twice to compare different data types.
- Understand the differences between the following operators:
  - greater than (`>`)
  - greater than or equals (`>=`)
  - less than (`<`)
  - less than or equals (`<=`)
- Use each of these operators at least twice to compare different data types.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 7"

### Step 8

- Declare a variable `result0` and assign the value of the equation `5 + 3 * 2` to it.
- Before logging the value of `result0`, try to anticipate the answer.
- Declare a variable `result1` and assign the value of the equation `10 / 2 + 3` to it.
- Declare a variable `result2` and assign the value of the equation `10 / (2 + 3)` to it.
- Before logging the values of `result1` and `result2`, anticipate the answers.
- Compare the results of `result1` and `result2` and explain the difference.
- Commit: "Challenge 1 - Done with Step 8"
